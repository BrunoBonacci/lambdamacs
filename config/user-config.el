;; The way Cider formats the code isn't particularly nice.  To format
;; the code properly you need to have a repl running and the code
;; needs to be loaded. Because of this the formatting changes
;; depending on which state your IDE is. I think it is a bad idea.  I
;; rather have a less appealing formatting, but which can be done
;; without having to load/compile the code.  (Î»macs) performs a
;; reformatting of the code on save with a definition which doesn't
;; take into account which particular form you are in.  However there
;; are times this is not convenient, like when working on someone else
;; code. To disable the code-reformat set the following variable to
;; `nil' You can toggle the value with `M-x cljfmt-toggle-reformat`.
